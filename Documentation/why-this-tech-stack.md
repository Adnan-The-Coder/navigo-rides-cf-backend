## ✅ Why This Stack?

### ⚡ Cloudflare Workers – Edge-First Serverless Compute

* Globally distributed compute → near-zero latency for mobile users anywhere.
* Auto-scaling, no provisioning, no cold starts.
* Free tier suitable for MVPs.
* Built-in DDoS and rate limiting.

### 🧱 HonoJS – Lightweight Web Framework

* Blazing fast, edge-native, TypeScript support.
* Express-style API syntax.
* Zero bloat, works natively on Workers.

### 🗄️ D1 – Cloudflare’s Serverless SQL Database

* SQLite-based, replicated globally.
* Ideal for transactional data (users, rides, payments).
* No hosting or infra setup required.

### 🧠 Drizzle ORM – Typed SQL & Migrations

* Full TypeScript safety with schema-first development.
* Clean SQL migrations.
* Works with D1 and other modern DBs.

### 📍 Redis – Real-time Driver Location Management

* `GEOADD` / `GEORADIUS` for geo-searching nearby drivers.
* Sub-ms latency, in-memory reads/writes.
* Redis via Upstash (HTTP API) works natively with Workers.

### 📦 pnpm – Fast, Efficient Package Manager

* Faster installs and lower disk usage vs npm/yarn.
* Strict dependency resolution → fewer bugs.
* Workspaces support for multi-package architecture (future scalability).
* Ideal for modern monorepos and CI/CD pipelines.

## ❌ Known Limitations & Mitigations

| Limitation                             | Mitigation                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D1 write throughput is limited         | Use Redis for real-time data; write summaries to D1                           |
| No native WebSockets in Workers        | Use Upstash Pub/Sub or Cloudflare Durable Objects                             |
| Vendor lock-in to Cloudflare & Upstash | Abstract interfaces, define migration paths (Turso, PlanetScale, Vercel Edge) |
| Redis latency via HTTP (Upstash)       | Still fast for GPS updates; use WebSockets for push                           |
| Ecosystem still evolving               | Actively maintained, Cloudflare community growing fast                        |

## 🔧 Project Tooling Notes

### ✅ Using `pnpm` over `npm` or `yarn`

| Feature        | Why it Matters                                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Speed**      | Installs faster than npm/yarn, saves CI time.      |
| **Strictness** | No hoisting by default → fewer dependency bugs.    |
| **Efficiency** | Shared store → reduced disk usage across projects. |
| **Workspaces** | Future-ready for monorepo/microservice expansion.  |
